# IP Tracking and Location Notification System

#Abstract:

ParentSafe is a valuable tool for concerned parents seeking a general understanding of their child's online presence. It works by discreetly tracking a device's IP address, resolving it to an approximate geographical location, and then automatically sending email notifications with map visualizations to the parent's inbox. ParentSafe aims to enhance parental awareness without compromising a child's trust or invading their privacy.

#Overview

##Key Features:

IP Tracking: Utilizes robust 'geo' libraries to accurately monitor device IP addresses.
Location Mapping: Transforms raw IP address data into approximate geographical coordinates, plotting locations on user-friendly embedded maps.
Automated Email Notifications: Integrates seamlessly with Redmail to deliver regular location updates directly to a parent's email, ensuring they stay informed.
Privacy-Centric Design: Developed with a child's safety and right to a degree of privacy in mind. ParentSafe offers an additional level of awareness, not a substitute for regular and open communication about responsible internet use.
Usage

##Installation: Install the ParentSafe package using pip: pip install parentsafe
Configuration: Secure a Redmail API key and input it into the configuration. Customize the frequency of email notifications based on your preference.
Run: Initiate the tracking process with the command parentsafe start.
##Getting Started

Redmail Setup: Create a Redmail account and obtain an API key.
Understanding Limitations: Recognize that IP-based geolocation offers an estimate of location; it cannot provide pinpoint accuracy like GPS tracking.
Responsible Use: Utilize ParentSafe as a tool to foster conversations about internet safety and responsible online behavior, not as a means of constant surveillance.
Important Notes

IP addresses can sometimes be associated with a general region rather than a specific address.
Be transparent with your child about the use of this tool, emphasizing its purpose in promoting online safety.
